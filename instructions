# Implement a logic to calculate the BMI of any user.
# Henceforth, display the results as either:
# 1. Underweight 2. Normal weight 3. Overweight
# 4. Obese.
# Use the formula BMI = weight in Kgs divide by height
# in metres squared.

# Use the scale:
# 18 and below ------ Underweight
# 18.1 ---- 29 ------ Normal weight
# 29.1 ---- 34 ------ Overweight
# 34.1 and above  ------ Obese
