# Implement a logic to calculate the BMI of any user.
# Henceforth, display the results as either:
# 1. Underweight 2. Normal weight 3. Overweight
# 4. Obese.
# Use the formula BMI = weight in Kgs divide by height
# in metres squared.

# Use the scale:
# 18 and below ------ Underweight
# 18.1 ---- 29 ------ Normal weight
# 29.1 ---- 34 ------ Overweight
# 34.1 and above  ------ Obese



1. Using a for loop print values for the dictionary below:

Â 

my_dict = {
    "apple": 2.99,
    "banana": 1.50,
    "orange": 0.99,
    "grape": 3.50,
    "watermelon": 5.99,
    "pineapple": 4.99
}

2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz"
 instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
 For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
